# An imagined healthy structure for company truely cares about data.

- a set of teams either aligned with product/business domains or be part of product/business domains, each 
  - consists of data scientists and data engineers who know the product/business domain and work closely with aligned  product/business team
  - mines and manages data insights needed by aligned product/business domain.
  
- a horizontal team which manages raw data sets, integrated data sets and insights which could be leveraged across product/business domains and all vertical data teams.
  
- a horizontal team which focuses on data infrastructure/platform/framework works, which typically includes 
  - data storage solutions and deployments
  - batch compute platforms and deployments, which may or may not with machine learning capability
  - streaming platforms and deployments
  - streaming compute platforms/frameworks and deployments, which may or may not with machine learning capability
  - data visualization solutions and deployments
  - data pipeline orchestration solutions and deployments
  - OLAP platforms and deployments
  - data govenance solutions and deployments
  - data delivery solutions
  
IMO, it's important to separate data centric teams from data infrastructure/platform/framework teams, for following reasons,

- data centric teams' focus is data. They are closer to busines and their values are realized in 
  - business decisions influenced by data
  - business metrics driven by data
  - product healthiness indicated by data
  - product features powered by data
  - product improvement driven by data
  - etc. by data
  
- infrastructure/platform/framework teams' responsibility is to provide playground for data centric teams. They are imporant but less closer to business, and their values are realized in
  - enable data centric teams to do a better work to get value out of data, by maintaining a great playground.
  
- mind set/skill sets/passions of people working on data is very different from that of those working on infrastructure/platform/framework. 
  - a data centric org under a leader with strong infra/platform/framework background but not keen to data and value of data is less effective. Similarly, a data infra/platform/framework org under a leader with focus on data but not paying enough attention to tech stack is also less effective.
  - data centric team lacks of skill sets and passion to build and operate infrastructure/platform/framework. Meanwhile, infra/platform/framework people might not have a good understanding in data work and its values. 
  
- as a matter of fact, both types of work nowadays are so demanding, each needs its own dedication, so each type of work needs dedicated team consisting of right set of people with right set of skills.
